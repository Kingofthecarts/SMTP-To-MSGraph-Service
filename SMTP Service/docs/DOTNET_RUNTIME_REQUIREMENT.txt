DOCUMENTATION UPDATE - .NET 9 DESKTOP RUNTIME REQUIREMENT
================================================================================
Date: 2025-10-01
Update: Added .NET 9 Desktop Runtime installation instructions

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Added comprehensive documentation about the requirement to install .NET 9
Desktop Runtime for end users who want to run the application without 
Visual Studio or the full .NET SDK.

This is CRITICAL for users as the application will not run without the runtime.

================================================================================
FILES UPDATED
================================================================================

1. README.md
   ✓ Added new "Prerequisites" subsection for .NET 9 Desktop Runtime
   ✓ Included download link
   ✓ Installation instructions

   ✓ Positioned BEFORE NuGet packages section (users see it first)

2. README.txt
   ✓ Updated STEP 1: PREREQUISITES section
   ✓ Added .NET 9 Desktop Runtime to checklist
   ✓ Marked as CRITICAL with clear emphasis
   ✓ Step-by-step installation instructions
   ✓ Verification instructions

3. SETUP_CHECKLIST.txt
   ✓ Added NEW "STEP 0" for .NET 9 Desktop Runtime installation
   ✓ Positioned BEFORE all other steps (can't do anything without it)
   ✓ Checkboxes for each installation step
   ✓ Clear warning: "WILL NOT RUN without this runtime installed"
   ✓ Renumbered existing steps (STEP 1 is now STEP 2, etc.)

4. PROJECT_COMPLETE.txt
   ✓ Added "STEP 0" to NEXT STEPS section
   ✓ Marked as CRITICAL!
   ✓ Download link and verification steps
   ✓ All caps warning for emphasis
   ✓ Renumbered existing steps

================================================================================
KEY INFORMATION ADDED
================================================================================

Download Link:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0

What to Download:
"Download .NET Desktop Runtime 9.0.x"

Platform Options:
- Windows x64 (64-bit)
- Windows x86 (32-bit)

Verification Command:
dotnet --list-runtimes

Expected Output:
Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.x

Why It's Needed:
The application is built with .NET 9 and requires the Desktop Runtime
to execute. Without it, the .exe will not start.

================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
================================================================================

All documentation now follows this hierarchy:

1. .NET 9 Desktop Runtime (NEW - Step 0)
   ↓
2. NuGet Packages / Build (Step 1)
   ↓
3. Azure AD Setup (Step 2)
   ↓
4. Build Project (Step 3)
   ↓
5. Configure Service (Step 4)
   ↓
6. Install as Service (Step 5)
   ↓
7. Test (Step 6+)

This ensures users install the runtime BEFORE attempting anything else.

================================================================================
USER VISIBILITY
================================================================================

The .NET 9 Runtime requirement is now prominently displayed in:

✓ First section of README.md (under Prerequisites)
✓ STEP 1 of README.txt (Quick Start Guide)
✓ STEP 0 of SETUP_CHECKLIST.txt (before everything)
✓ STEP 0 of PROJECT_COMPLETE.txt (Next Steps)
✓ REQUIREMENTS section of PROJECT_NOTES.txt
✓ First troubleshooting step in RUN_MODE_FEATURE.txt

Users cannot miss this requirement!

================================================================================
CONSISTENCY
================================================================================

All documentation uses:
✓ Same download link
✓ Same verification command
✓ Same expected output
✓ Same terminology ("Desktop Runtime")
✓ Same emphasis (CRITICAL, REQUIRED, WILL NOT RUN)
✓ Same installation steps

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Runtime Name: Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App
Version: 9.0.x (latest patch)
Platform: Windows
Type: Desktop Runtime (includes ASP.NET Core Runtime)
Architecture: x64 or x86

Why Desktop Runtime and not just .NET Runtime:
- Application uses Windows Forms (System tray GUI)
- Requires Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App
- Regular .NET Runtime doesn't include Windows Forms support

================================================================================
VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Users can verify installation by:

1. Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
2. Run: dotnet --list-runtimes
3. Look for: Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.x

If not found:
- Runtime is not installed
- Application will not start
- Download and install from link provided

================================================================================
ERROR PREVENTION
================================================================================

Without .NET 9 Desktop Runtime, users would see:
- "This application requires the .NET Desktop Runtime 9.0.x"
- "To run this application, install .NET Desktop Runtime"
- Or the application simply won't start

Now with clear documentation BEFORE they try to run it, users:
✓ Know what they need
✓ Know where to get it
✓ Know how to verify it
✓ Can install it before encountering errors

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
================================================================================

Files Modified: 6
New Sections Added: 7
Steps Renumbered: All setup steps (0-based now)
Download Links Added: 6
Verification Commands Added: 6

Purpose: Ensure all users install .NET 9 Desktop Runtime before
attempting to run the application, preventing startup failures
and support requests.

Result: Clear, consistent documentation that prevents the most
common deployment issue (missing runtime).

================================================================================
COMPLETENESS CHECK

✓ Installation instructions provided
✓ Download link in all relevant docs
✓ Verification steps included
✓ Platform requirements specified
✓ Positioned prominently (STEP 0 or first prereq)
✓ Emphasis used (CRITICAL, REQUIRED)
